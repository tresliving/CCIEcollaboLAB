# CCIEcollaboLAB
Building the a modern CCIE-level lab that will help me pass!

On December 24, 2024 I walked as a college graduate from Florida International University. I studied MIS. I really only enjoyed Introduction to Telecommunications. 
On October 15, 2024. I gained a role as a Jr. Unified Communications Systems Analyst.
On November 11, 2024 I figured out what my long term goal was.
On October 23, 2024, after studying the CCNA + CCNP material I felt ready to begin studying for the CCIE.
Now I am working on the configs for this, and implementing the solutions on a daily as a UC/ Voice Engineer and Consultant.
The dream is what I am living. Working in the Bronx and Midtown Manhattan. Living in Queens. Loving every second of the journey.
But the hunger I have has altered a tad. Now, I'm pickier in my diet. I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm a bit obsessive.
I really want this CCIE. In the beginning I have no clue what I was doing, but now I kinda get it.
Long term goal = obtain the CCIE Collaboration/. Maybe get a role that sends me to a coastline with a pretty girl on my hip, and a fat wallet to explore this beautiful big mudball!!!!!
NetworkChuck. Databunny, Patrick Kinane, INE with Rohit Pardasani...and all of my mentors are where I mostly learn.
